# To-Do-List-Angular

Welcome to my To-Do List using Angular! This application was completed over the course of 3 days and was created with the intention of learning how to implement CRUD operations using Angular for the front-end. Three items for a grocery list have already been supplied. All you need to do is input an item name and the quantity, hit the "Submit" button, and your new entry will be added to the list! You can also delete and update items from the list if needed
